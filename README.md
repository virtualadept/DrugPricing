# Drug Pricing

This imports the data from https://data.medicaid.gov FUL/NADAC csv into a mysql/mariadb database and allows you to run queries on pricing data by NDC and date range.

If you have no idea what FUL or NADAC mean, you probably don't want this.

Meant for an internal website. No security, no auth, use at your own risk.

I'm a pharmacist, not a coder, so expect duct-tape and bailing wire.

Pull requests welcome.  If you actually use this, drop me a line!
